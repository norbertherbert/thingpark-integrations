# ThingPark Integrations
This repository includes example code that demonstrates how to integrate Actility ThingPark components with 3rd party systems.  
Most of the examples are in the form of Node-RED flows. In order to try them you need to use a Node-RED server that you can install either on your server locally or use in IBM Cloud.
