# ThingPark Integrations
This repository includes example code that demonstrates how to integrate Actility ThingPark components with 3rd party systems.  
Most of the examples are in the form of Node-RED flows. In order to try them you need a Node-RED server that you can install either on your own machine locally or use it on IBM Cloud.
## Installing a Node-RED Server
We recommend you either installing a Nede-RED server on your own computer/server machine locally or test in on IBM cloud.  
The process of local installation is described here:  
https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local  
If you prefer to test the solution on IBM cloud follow the procedure explined under the following link.

## Installing sample flows
All all samples of this repository are stored in JSON files that you can import into your Node-RED installation as described under the following link:
